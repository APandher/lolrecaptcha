Time to learn the go language.
We crack the recaptcha because it's Christmas.
We want the Merry Christmas for all!

Sorry I am golang noob and code is low quality and shit
Will eventually use handcoded low quality convnet maybe

Anyone have clever ideas to get ground truth?
Maybe we unsupervised cluster and then write a paper
Because to date that will the #1 use of unsupervised learning

I go on some dates in NYC tomorrow so maybe we finish this today?
--> Probs not dawg it takes 2 hours in golang what takes you 5 mintues in Python
--> Maybe breaking recaptcha will be a fun date activity? Will ask. Very cheap!

Goal is breaking the demo @ https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo

== Project Updates ==

Christmas afternoon:
* Lots of people in my house. It is loud. The fetcher is working.
