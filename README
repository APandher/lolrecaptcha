Time to learn the go language.
We crack the recaptcha because it's Christmas.
We want the Merry Christmas for all!

Sorry I am golang noob and code is low quality and shit
Will eventually use handcoded low quality convnet maybe

Anyone have clever ideas to get ground truth?
Maybe we unsupervised cluster and then write a paper
Because to date that will be the #1 use of unsupervised learning

I go on some dates in NYC tomorrow so maybe we finish this today?
--> Probs not dawg it takes 2 hours in golang what takes you 5 minutes in Python
--> Maybe breaking recaptcha will be a fun date activity? Will ask. Very cheap!

Goal is breaking the demo @ https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo

Also I realize clicking street signs is probably training the Google Self Driving Car
Cheaters.

Christmas afternoon:
* Lots of people in my house. It is loud. The fetcher is working.

Christmas night:
* Been in battle to get more data. Google loves data and hates sharing. Got blocked.
* Made threads to get fast data. I now have 50842 alleged street sign pictures.
* They are alleged only though. We need to train a binary classifier.

Morning after christmas:
* Got bagels. I love bagels

== Project Bullshit ==

* WE ARE ON HACKER NEWS
